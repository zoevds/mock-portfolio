    <h1>The reasons why i would like to visit the colosseum</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>The colosseum is one of the largest amphitheatres ever built.</li>
      <li>
        Italy was always one of the countries i wanted to travel to but the
        colosseum was one of the biggest world heritage sites and thats what
        caught my eyes
      </li>
      <li>
        Despite the fact that the colosseum is over 1,900 years old , its is
        still standing and i find the architecture very beautiful and unique
      </li>
      <li>
        I would like to learn more abouth the activities that were done in the
        colosseum many years ago when it was made , such as, gladiator contests,
        animals hunts and the re-enactments of famous battles, etc.
      </li>
      <li>
        The colosseum was destroyed by the great earthquake in 1349, causing the
        outer south side to collapse. Many of the tumbked stones was then used
        to built churches, palaces and hospitals elesewhere in rome.
      </li>
    </ul>
